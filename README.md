# Relativistic game engine.

This is a game engine that has special shaders for simulating relativistic motion. It's also an opportunity for me to learn about OpenGL and Rust.

A lot of the "starter code" comes from bwasty's repo about converting Joey DeVries OpenGL tutorials to Rust. https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs
