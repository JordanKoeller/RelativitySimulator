# Things to improve on the renderer:

A. Sprite rendering through a geometry shader
2. Using Uniform Buffer Objects
3. Instancing
4. Batched Rendering
5. A priority queue that isn't destroyed every frame

## Priority Considerations

### (Estimated) Performance improvement

1. Priority Queue
2. Instancing
3. Batched Rendering
4. UBOs

### (Estimated) Ease of Implementation

1. UBOs
2. Priority Queue
3. Batched Rendering
4. Instancing

### I will follow the "ease of implementation" order.
